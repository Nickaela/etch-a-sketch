This is for etch a sketch project. I don't have idea yet on what result I'll be expecting but I'm excited and nervous at the same time.

Hope I finish this project!

Update: Project is finished after a week. I was able to add prompt for user's preferred number of squares per side, randomize the colors when mouse enters and leaves and limit of 100x100. I understand that the javascript code isn't as clean or organize as it should be, but, this project wasn't easy. I had to research and read and backtrack topics because I forgot them. Anyway, I'll go back to this project one day definitely and will laugh about how I did the js file but surely, I will recode it using future learnings and experience.
